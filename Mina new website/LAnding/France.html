        <h1>Eiffel Tower, Paris</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>The Eiffel Tower (La Tour Eiffel)</strong> is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. 
            Standing at <strong>330 meters (1,083 feet)</strong>, it dominates the skyline of Paris and serves as 
            a symbol of elegance, romance, and architectural brilliance. Originally built for the 
            <strong>1889 Exposition Universelle</strong>, it has become the heart of the French capital.
        </p>
        <p>
            Located in the <strong>Champ de Mars</strong> beside the Seine River, the Eiffel Tower offers stunning 
            panoramic views of Paris. Whether admired from a distance or experienced from the top, 
            it remains a must-visit attraction for travelers from all around the world.
        </p>

                <h2>Going to a Café Near the Eiffel Tower</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the things I look forward to the most is enjoying a cup of coffee at a traditional 
                    <strong>Parisian café</strong> with a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower. Sitting outside, 
                    watching people pass by, and soaking in the relaxed Parisian atmosphere would be an 
                    unforgettable experience. I imagine savoring a fresh croissant and a rich café au lait, 
                    feeling the true essence of Parisian culture. The idea of spending a peaceful morning 
                    at a charming café near the Eiffel Tower makes this trip even more special for me.

                <h2>Experiencing the Eiffel Tower Lights</h2>
                <p>
                    The Eiffel Tower transforms into a dazzling wonder at night, illuminated by 
                    <strong>20,000 golden lights</strong>. I dream of witnessing the spectacular 
                    <strong>hourly light show</strong>, where the tower sparkles beautifully against the dark sky. 
                    The romantic atmosphere, combined with the stunning reflections along the Seine, would make 
                    this an unforgettable experience.

                <h2>Seeing Paris from the Top</h2>
                <p>
                    Climbing to the top of the Eiffel Tower is something I’ve always wanted to do. 
                    From the observation deck, I’d love to see the whole city of Paris, including 
                    landmarks like the <strong>Seine River, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe</strong>. 
                    Standing at the top, taking in the view, and feeling the excitement of being in 
                    one of the most beautiful cities in the world would be a dream come true.
