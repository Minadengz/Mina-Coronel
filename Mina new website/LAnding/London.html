        <h1>Tower Bridge, London</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Tower Bridge</strong> is one of London’s most famous landmarks and a true symbol of the city. 
            Built between <strong>1886 and 1894</strong>, this magnificent **bascule and suspension bridge** 
            spans the <strong>River Thames</strong>, connecting the central and eastern parts of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tower Bridge is not only a functional crossing but also a popular attraction, offering breathtaking 
            views of London from its **high-level walkways** and **glass floors**. Whether admiring its grand 
            structure from the riverbanks or walking across it, this historic bridge is a must-visit destination.
        </p>

                <h2>Enjoying a Café Near Tower Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my dreams is to have a relaxing morning at a charming <strong>London café</strong> 
                    near Tower Bridge. Sipping on a warm cup of <strong>English tea</strong> or <strong>coffee</strong> 
                    while watching the iconic bridge and the bustling Thames River sounds like a perfect way to soak in the 
                    beauty of London. I can imagine sitting by the window, enjoying a delicious breakfast, and taking in the 
                    city's unique atmosphere.

                <h2>Seeing Tower Bridge at Night</h2>
                <p>
                    At night, Tower Bridge lights up beautifully, reflecting off the Thames and creating a magical view. 
                    I dream of taking an evening stroll along the river, capturing the stunning illuminated bridge, 
                    and feeling the historic charm of London at night.

                <h2>Walking on the Tower Bridge Glass Walkway</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most exciting things I’d love to experience is walking across the **glass walkway** of 
                    Tower Bridge. Looking down through the glass panels while standing high above the River Thames 
                    would be both thrilling and breathtaking. The panoramic view of London from the top is something 
                    I can’t wait to witness in person!
