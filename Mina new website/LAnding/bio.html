        <h3>My Childhood Years</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Gemina</strong>, and for now, I will tell my childhood story.<sup>2</sup>To be honest, I don’t remember much from my childhood, but there are a few things I hold dear.
            <sup>3</sup>I remember loving to play outside with my friends. <sup>4</sup>Playing under the warm sun brought endless joy, and laughter always filled the air.
            <sup>5</sup>My feet would race across the soft grass, and I felt free with every step.<sup>6</sup>The open sky seemed to stretch wide, inviting
            moments of energy and movement. <sup>7</sup>There was always a fresh breeze that rushed past,
            making every jump, spin, and sprint feel more exciting. <sup>8</sup>Time seemed to slow down in
            that golden light, making everything feel more magical. <sup>9</sup>Each step, every breath, and
            every heartbeat was full of simple happiness. <sup>10</sup>Running and playing under the sun was
            all I needed to feel complete. <sup>11</sup>I loved playing with all the kids around my age. <sup>12</sup>We would
            create games and explore every corner of the neighborhood. <sup>13</sup>Since I was the youngest,
            there was a big age gap between me and my brothers. <sup>14</sup>Because of that, I often played
            with other kids instead of them. <sup>15</sup>My brothers were older, so they were usually busy with
            their activities, leaving me to seek adventure outside. <sup>16</sup>I didn’t mind, though, because
            being with other kids made me feel like I belonged. <sup>17</sup>We would laugh, race, and
            sometimes even argue, but the fun never stopped. <sup>18</sup>Every day felt like a new adventure,
            full of possibilities. <sup>19</sup>Looking back, I realize how much those moments meant to me.
            <sup>20</sup>They shaped who I am and gave me memories that I still cherish. <sup>21</sup>The laughter, the
            games, the freedom—all of it stays with me. <sup>22</sup>It was a time when everything felt simple
            and full of wonder.</p>

        <h3>My Teenage Years</h3>
        <p> The world seemed to shift, and I noticed things I hadn't seen before.<sup>3</sup>I realized that
            reacting impulsively, as I did when I was younger, wasn't always the best approach. <sup>4</sup>It became clear that I needed to analyze situations before responding. <sup>5</sup>I started to understand that every situation was more complicated than I initially thought, and it was important to take the time to think it through. <sup>6</sup>This shift in perspective helped me make better decisions and respond with more thoughtfulness. <sup>7</sup>I learned that reacting based on emotions wasn’t always the right choice. <sup>8</sup>Patience became something I valued deeply, not just waiting for time to pass but allowing myself to reflect on what was happening. <sup>9</sup>I also started becoming more aware of how my actions affect others. <sup>10</sup>I
            realized that I couldn't always act on my first instinct, especially if it could hurt someone unintentionally. <sup>11</sup>I became more mindful of how my words and behavior could impact those around me. <sup>12</sup>Learning to express myself in ways that were honest but respectful of others was an important part of this growth. <sup>13</sup>It wasn’t always easy to find the balance,
            and I struggled with it at times, but I was learning. <sup>14</sup>There were moments when I questioned myself more than I ever had before. <sup>15</sup>Was I making the right decision? <sup>16</sup>Was I being fair to myself and others? <sup>17</sup>These moments of doubt were frustrating, but I soon realized that they were part of the process. <sup>18</sup>They were opportunities for growth and
            self-reflection. <sup>19</sup>As I learned to take a step back and think through my reactions, I began
            to feel more in control. <sup>20</sup>My teenage years weren’t perfect, but they were when I learned
            the value of analyzing situations before acting.</p>

        <h3>My College Years</h3>
        <p>Now I’m in college, and with it came a lot of realizations.It’s not the same as when I was a kid. I can’t be carefree anymore, and the weight of responsibilities is heavier than I expected.<sup>4</sup>College has brought with it a whole new level of expectations,
            both from myself and others. <sup>5</sup>I quickly realized that the carefree days of my childhood were behind me, and it hit harder than I thought it would. <sup>6</sup>I found myself having to juggle school work, deadlines, and social life, and it wasn’t easy. <sup>7</sup>The pressure to perform well academically started to feel overwhelming at times. <sup>8</sup>I thought I was
            prepared for it, but nothing could have fully prepared me for the change. <sup>9</sup>In many ways, I still felt like I was stuck in my high school days, with the same old habits and mindset. <sup>10</sup>It wasn’t until I arrived in college that I felt the true extent of culture shock. <sup>11</sup>I was suddenly surrounded by people from different backgrounds and with different
            perspectives, and it left me feeling a little out of place. <sup>12</sup>Everyone seemed so sure of their path, so confident in their goals. <sup>13</sup>Meanwhile, I was trying to catch up, unsure of exactly where I fit in. <sup>14</sup>It felt like I had to relearn how to be independent and how to manage my time and emotions. <sup>15</sup>The freedom that I had imagined would come with college was different from what I expected. <sup>16</sup>But despite the challenges, I knew it was all part of the process. <sup>17</sup>Though it was hard, it was helping me become a stronger
            version of myself.</p>
